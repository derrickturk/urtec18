# URTEC 2018 PDF renamer

Unzip urtec-2018-3-days.zip somewhere.  

Navigate into it, ignore the `__MACOSX` directory. Drag the inner (not outer!) `urtec-2018-3-days` directory to `urtec2018.exe` and let it do its thing.  

You'll see some notes on links we couldn't find; there'll also be a `renamed` directory inside `urtec-2018-3-days` containing the renamed PDF files.
